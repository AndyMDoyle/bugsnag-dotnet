The Bugsnag Notifier for .NET gives you instant notification of exceptions
thrown from your .NET apps. Any uncaught exceptions will trigger a
notification to be sent to your Bugsnag project.

[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web,
mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them
as fast as possible. [Create a free account](https://www.bugsnag.com) to start
